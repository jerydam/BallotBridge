**Ballot Bridge Overview**

[Ballot Bridge](https://ballotbridge.vercel.app/) is a tool designed to make voting easy, secure, and fair by using blockchain technology. Imagine it as a digital system where elections can be held without the need for a central authority, ensuring that everything is transparent and tamper-proof.

### What Does [Ballot Bridge](https://ballotbridge.vercel.app/) Do?

1. **Creating Elections:** 
   - Anyone in charge of an election can set up a new one, giving it a name, add candidates, description, and specific dates for when voting starts and ends.

2. **Registering Voters:**
   - Before voting, people need to sign up as voters. To ensure security, they verify their identity with a special code sent to them.

3. **Casting Votes:**
   - Once registered, voters can choose their preferred candidate during the election period.

4. **Automatic Election End:**
   - The system automatically ends the election at the set time and announces the winner based on the votes.

5. **Accessing Election Information:**
   - Anyone can check the details of the election, like what it's about, who the candidates are, and who won.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Setting Up the Election:**
   - The election organizer starts by creating an election on the platform. This involves setting a title, description, and timeline.

2. **Voter Sign-Up:**
   - People who want to vote sign up through the platform. They receive a one-time password (OTP) to confirm their identity.

3. **Voting Process:**
   - When the election is live, registered voters can log in and cast their vote for their chosen candidate.

4. **Election End and Results:**
   - Once the election time is up, the system automatically closes the voting, counts the votes, and announces the winner without anyone needing to intervene.

5. **Checking the Election:**
   - Throughout the process, anyone can view information about the election, including the candidates and the final results.
